##  Objectives

1. Analyze monthly and yearly crime trends to identify patterns over time  
2. Determine the frequency and proportion of various crime types  
3. Identify areas with high concentrations of criminal activity  
4. Analyze the age, gender, and race of victims and suspects  
5. Examine how crime incidents vary by day of the week and time of day  
6. Investigate the types of weapons used in crimes and their prevalence  
7. Identify seasonal variations in crime occurrences  
8. Assess the frequency of repeat offenders  
9. Evaluate the influence of COVID-19 on crime trends  
10. Analyze the proportion of crimes solved or cleared by law enforcement

##  Data Preprocessing

- Converted `DATE OCC` to extract Year, Month, Day, and Weekday  
- Standardized `TIME OCC` into readable time periods  
- Dropped duplicates and missing values  
- Created new features (season, hour of crime, etc.) for deeper analysis  
- Mapped codes to human-readable formats (e.g., crime categories, weapon types)

##  Visualizations & Key Insights

- **Line Charts** for overall crime trends over time  
- **Bar & Pie Charts** showing top crime types, solved cases, and weapon usage  
- **Heatmaps** for area-wise crime hotspots and crime vs. weapon combinations  
- **Histograms** for age distributions of victims and suspects  
- **Time-Based Plots** to analyze variation by day, hour, and season  
- **COVID Timeline Analysis** to examine changes before, during, and after lockdowns

##  Key Takeaways

- *Vehicle theft** was consistently the most reported crime  
-  Crimes involving **firearms** were most common among violent offenses  
-  **Crime peaks during winter**, especially property crimes  
-  **Cybercrime and domestic violence increased** during COVID lockdown  
-  Only about **30% of crimes are solved**, with violent crimes having higher clearance rates
